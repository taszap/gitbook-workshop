Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons? How do I upscale? How do I increase my image’s resolution? How do I create variations? What does U and V do? What is U1-4, V1-4? What is an upscale? What is a variation?

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958191534208061450/1017592980053438494/1234.png

**U** UPSCALE: Increases the size of the selected image, giving it a higher resolution of around 1024×1024. See [the documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#upscaling).

**V** VARIATION: Creates 4 variations of the selected image, trying to maintain style and composition.

Note: each upscale/variation uses GPU-minutes.

---

Q: What does the ↻ button do? What does the recycle symbol do? What does the arrow do? How can I submit the same job again?

The ↻ submits the same job again, which will run with a different seed without removing your previous generation. You will see more variations of your initial prompt.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------GPU------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a gpu minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms for the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query?

midjourney measures each job using a resource called GPU time. GPU time is the amount of time it takes our servers to process your request. 

Each job takes roughly one GPU minute. Upscales use more time, variations use less. Specific parameters may also impact the amount of GPU time a job takes, especially the quality parameter (--q) and non-square aspect ratios (--ar 3:2, for example).

---

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left? How do I see how much I have used? How do I see how many hours I have left? Where can I check how many prompts I have left? How many images can I make? How can I see my queue? Where do I check my jobs? How do I check how many jobs I have left? /info? 

Use `/info` in a bot channel to check your subscription status and usage.

`Fast Time Remaining` shows the amount of image generation resources you still have access to. [What is GPU time?](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1032868548072185927/1062651515120128100/gpu_time.png)

---

Q: Can I use my GPU? Can I run this locally? Can I run this on my computer?

No, this is not offered at this time. The AI runs on datacenter grade graphics cards.

—

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details?

Optional credit-top ups allow you to purchase additional fast GPU time above what comes with your monthly subscription. This GPU time rolls over through subscription periods, unlike the time that comes with your plan, though you must have an active subscription in order to use it. Additional time purchased this way is used after your subscription and bonus fast time has been used.

The current rate for optional credit top-ups is $4/GPU hour, though these rates may change at any time. You can buy additional time by using /fast while you have no fast time available, or through your [account page on the website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/)

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

---

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?

Use `/relax` and `/fast` to toggle between Relax and Fast mode. In Relax mode, image generations don't count towards your monthly quota of Fast images. Relax mode doesn't support max-upscale commands but does support Beta upscale.
Please note: Relax mode is not available for the `Basic` plan and trial users. 

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode is based on a dynamic queueing system that resets every time your subscription renews.

---

Q: My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed? All my submissions are "relaxed", when can I have fast uploads again?

Use `/fast` in a bot channel to enable metered fast generation. You will be incrementally charged for each image if you are out of monthly Fast credits. You will need to set a spending limit before using metered Fast mode. Your plans' Fast time automatically renews on the same day of the month you started your current subscription.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight. Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while.  What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before?

`Relax` mode is based on a dynamic queueing system that tries to make sure all relax users have an equal chance to share the relax queue resources. The times to generate in relaxed mode change and can be anywhere from 0 to 5 minutes depending on factors like personal usage, collective usage, and resources available.

---


# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast-hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours?

We have two modes for image generation, `Fast` and `Relax`. `Fast` assigns your job to a GPU as quickly as possible. `Relax` adds your job to a queue behind others users based on how much you've used the system. `Relax` also doesn't support max-upscale commands.

Right now, we give 30 GPU-hours/mo of `Fast` with the `Pro` plan, 15 GPU-hours/mo with the `Standard` plan and 200 GPU-minutes/mo with the `Basic` plan.

One hour is roughly 60 image generation or upscale commands and approximately 200 image variation commands. These numbers are experimental and may change at any time.

---

Q: What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? How do I enable the additional fast time? 

You can purchase additional fast hours through your Manage Sub page [on the midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/), or by using `/fast` and following the prompts from the bot. Purchased hours, unlike the hours that come with your subscription, do not expire, though you must have an active subscription to use them.


---

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? Will my time get added to the next month? Does the subscription reset my hours? Do I keep my minutes?

Monthly hours do not rollover. If you purchased additional fast hours (through the website or by following the bot prompts), they do not expire. Hours earned from rating images on the website expire 30 days after they were awarded, regardless of when your subscription renews.

# -------------------- ------PERSONAL USE------ --------------------

Q: Can I invite midjourney to my server? Can I add this bot to another server? How to add midjourney to a different server? Can I add the bot to my Discord server? Can I use the bot in my server? Q: Can I get my own private channel? How do I get a private channel? Does a subscriber have its own private channel not viewed by the public? Will I have a private channel if I subscribe? Can I generate images in a private channel?

You can invite the Bot to your own server using [this guide](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/use-midjourney-on-your-own-discord-server). 

Subscribers can also create images in their direct messages with the Bot. Tap here to DM the Bot: <@936929561302675456>

No matter where you use the Bot, your images will still appear in the community feed, on the website. Pro plan subscribers can prevent this by enabling stealth mode with `/private`

# -------------------- ------TRIAL----- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------



Q: Do trials reset monthly? Do I get more free images every month? Do I get free images every day? How many images do I get as a free user? Do trials reset monthly? Does my free trial renew? Is my trial a limited number per day or overall? How long is the trial? How many images can we do with the Trial Version? How many images can you generate with the basic trial? How many images does the trial have? How many images does the trial have? How long does the free trial last? How do I refresh my trial?

Each new user gets a free trial of around 25 jobs (25 GPU minutes). This trial doesn’t renew but can be used over multiple days and doesn’t presently expire. Use /info to track your usage.

---

Q: Why isn’t this free? Do I really have to pay for this? Can you give me free access? No free? Do I have to pay? Why do I have to pay? Is there a free version? Can I use the program for free? Refresh?

midjourney does not provide a free tier because of the cost involved with using farms of hundreds of GPUs. Providing a free tier to users would be unsustainable at this time. Please note that the free trial is a one-time allocation of 25 GPU minutes, and creating alternate accounts to take advantage of the trial multiple times **WILL** result in a ban.

---


# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- SUBSCRIPTION --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Do subscriptions renew on the first of the month? When does my subscription renew?

Your subscription renews every month on the same day of the month and time of day it was started. You can check when your subscription will renew by using `/info`. Hover over the date in your info panel, or long press on mobile, to see the time. (Note that your subscription may renew an hour earlier or later than you expect following daylight saving time changes.)

Q: Can I pay with PayPal? Can I use PayPal? Do you have other payment methods? Paypal PayPal? Do I have to use a credit card? Are there other ways to pay? Is there another way to pay for a subscription other than with a credit card? Can I pay with ETH? Do you take crypto?

Only payment methods that work with Stripe are currently supported.: credit or debit cards issued by services like Mastercard, VISA, American Express, or Discover & Diners. Wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Alipay may work in specific regions. [More info on card brands supported by Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/cards/supported-card-brands)

PayPal, wire transfer, and similar methods are not supported. There is currently no estimate on supporting more payment options.

---


Q: Will a yearly subscription become available? Are the payments lifetime or monthly? Is the subscription price paid per month?


Plans can be purchased on a month-to-month basis, or as an annual commitment. Annual commitments are charged upfront, at a 20% discount from the month-to-month price, but otherwise function the same way (i.e. your fast hours will still refresh on the same day every month).

---

Q: Is it paid to make images? Aw I need to pay? Do I need to pay? Trial has ended?

We give new users a free trial of roughly 25 jobs (25 GPU minutes). After the free trial, you can purchase additional jobs by subscribing to the Basic, Standard, or Pro plan.

---



# -------------------- METERED --------------------
Q: if we go over our limit of fast hours does it let us know? or just start billing for the extra hourly time with no warning? If I use up minutes, can I get more without paying? Can you accidently get a big bill?

When you run out of fast time, you will be prompted to either purchase additional GPU hours or, for Standard and Pro subscribers, move to relax mode. These additional GPU hours must be purchased before they can be used, so you can’t accidentally incur additional charges. If you have a Standard or Pro subscription, you can use `/relax` to switch to relaxed mode.

---



# -------------------- CANCELATION --------------------

Q: How can I cancel? How can I cancel my plan? How do I unsubscribe? How can I cancel my subscription? How to cancel a subscription? Where do I cancel my subscription? How do I unsub? Where do I unsub? Where do I cancel? How can I cancle? How can I cancle my plan? How can I cancle my subscription? How to cancle a subscription? Where do I cancle my subscription? Where do I cancle?

You can cancel your subscription on [the midjourney 
website](https://midjourney.com/account), or by using `/subscribe` and following the link

On the website next to `Plan Details` click `Manage` and then `Cancel Plan` 

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1023057817155944519/1063046121989095454/Screenshot_2023-01-12_at_5.43.52_AM.png

You may cancel your subscription anytime, but the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle. All the benefits and `/fast` time will remain until the end of this cycle. If you change your mind, you can un-cancel your plan before the end of the cycle.

---

Q: When I unsubscribe will I still have access to my website gallery? If I cancel will I still be able to see my images on the gallery? If I cancel my subscription can I still see my images?

You can continue to access your online images gallery even if you're not currently a paid member.

---



# -------------------- SWITCH PLANS --------------------

Q: If I want to switch plans will I be charged the full amount? What if I go from basic plan to standard? Can I change my plan? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I switch plans? If I switch to Standard it will be 20$ or 30$ ? Can I upgrade from basic to standard?

If you switch from Basic to Standard, your percentage of remaining GPU-time / images will be deducted from your 30$ upgrade.

If you used all of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 30$.
If you used half of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 25$
If you used no Basic time -> Standard will cost $20

Likewise, if you switch from Standard to Pro, your upgrade will be prorated based on your remaining fast time.

When switching plans, you can decide to have the change go into effect immediately, or at the end of your current billing cycle. If you choose to have the change go into effect immediately, your current fast time will convert into a discount on your new plan, or account credit if you’re swapping to a smaller plan. If you choose to swap from the Standard or Pro plan to Basic and have it go into effect immediately, you will immediately lose access to relax mode.

---


# -------------------- TRANSFER --------------------

Q: Can I transfer my subscription to another account? I used the wrong account? I subscribed with the wrong account?

We can transfer subscriptions between accounts only when both accounts have the same owner. You will need to provide proof of ownership for both accounts and the subscription that needs to be transferred.

---


# -------------------- QUEUE --------------------

Q: How many jobs can be generating at once? How many jobs can I line up? How long is the queue? How many concurrent jobs can I run? How many can I queue?

Trial, `Basic`, and `Standard` subscribers can have **3 jobs** running at once. Additional jobs will be added to a queue of up to **10 jobs**.

`Pro` subscribers can run **12 jobs** at once with `/fast`, **3 jobs** at once with `/relax`, and an additional **10 jobs** in the queue. 

---





# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- ----PRIVATE---- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? What if I don’t want my images to appear in the gallery?

midjourney strives to be a community for mutual sharing and exploration. If for any reason you prefer not to participate in midjourney's open community, you can subscribe to the Pro plan at any time. The Pro plan has a 'Stealth' feature that allows you to selectively publish and unpublish your creations from your public Gallery and the community feed.

---

Q: How do I hide my images? What's private mode? What’s stealth mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images. How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts. How do I go private? How do I go stealth? How much does private cost? How much does stealth cost?

Stealth (formerly private) generation mode is a feature of the Pro plan. It prevents other users from seeing your images on midjourney.com and allows you to hide previously generated images.

You must generate in your Direct Messages or on a private Discord server for your images to be completely private. Images generated in public channels are still visible to other users.

While you are subscribed to the Pro plan, you can hide or show previously generated images in your personal gallery by clicking on the “eye” icon. If the icon doesn’t appear, try using the /info command, logging out, and then re-logging into the website.

---


Q: Is private permanent? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth?

Any images marked private during your subscription will remain private even after your subscription ends.

---

Q: I can’t see the eye icon. I can’t unpublish on the website.

If the eye icon doesn’t appear, try using the /info command, logging out, and then re-logging into the website.

---

Q: Are all my images private automatically? Will my gallery become private? Why can users still interact even though I bought private? Are all my images stealth automatically? Will my gallery be stealth? Why can users interact even though I have stealth mode enabled?

In order to use stealth generation mode, you’ll need to enable it with `/private` Any previously made images will need to have their visibility toggled on the website with the unpublish button (an eye icon).

In order to make sure your stealth generations are actually private, make sure to generate them inside a DM to the bot or in a private server. Generating in a public channel will show the image to everyone.

---

Q: How do I hide my images on the website? How do I unpublish my images? Unpublish old images? Bulk unpublish? Bulk hide? Hide old images? Hide already made images? Unpublish already made images? Batch hide? Batch unpublish?

Subscribers to the Pro plan can use bulk actions on the website to unpublish (hide) their images–from either the archive page or the gallery with select mode enabled, select the images you’d like to unpublish. On the green “Open Downloader” button that appears at the bottom of the screen, click the down arrow to change the functionality to “Unpublish”, then click the button to unpublish those images.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- UPSCALE & SIZE --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: How do I change my aspect ratio? How to change aspect ratio? How can I specify image width? How can I specify image height? How can I change the dimensions? How to make not square images? What is the prompt for width and height? Can I adjust the width and height? What is --ar? How do I make a desktop background? How do I make 16:9?

Change the aspect ratio of your image with the `--ar` parameter. 
Ex: `/imagine prompt: cyberpunk cats --ar 2:3` 

Version 4 of midjourney currently supports `2:3` and `3:2`. For wider aspect ratios like 16:9, you can use Version 3 with the `/settings` command.

[Aspect Ratio Documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#sizes) for more information.

---

Q How can I prevent preview and upscale to add too much detail? The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

Use `/settings` before submitting a prompt to choose the amount of detail that is added during your upscale.
`Beta Upscale` is the Closest match to grid images.
`Light Upscale` adds a small amount of detail when upscaling images.
`Regular Upscale` adds the most detail when upscaling images.

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using Version 4, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in `/fast` mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image’s resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` switch in a prompt, or hit the “Light Upscale Redo” button under upscaled images.

---

Q: What is "Beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is "beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is upbeta?

Beta upscale uses a different algorithm that adds flat textured smooth detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--upbeta` switch in a prompt, or hit the “Beta Upscale Redo” button under upscaled images.


---

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print it out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution?

For square images, `Regular` and `Light`* upscale produces 1024x1024 px and `Maximum Upscale`* is 1664x1664 px (~3MB). `Beta Upscale` is 2048 x 2048 px (~4MB). 

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.

* *Light and Max upscale are for Version 3 of midjourney.*
[Image Size Documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/understanding-image-size)

---

Q: Why does my upscale look different? Why is my upscale messed up? Upscale is different from the grid. Why does the V4 upscaler suck? Is the V4 upscaler broken? Why are my upscales coming out different?

The default upscaler for V4 takes the prompt into account, unlike previous upscalers. This means it sometimes makes changes to the grid image as part of the process–for better or for worse. If you don’t like the results, try the “Beta Upscale Redo” button. The beta upscaler tends to stick closer to the grid image than the Version 4 default upscaler :)

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

Yes, with --iw -0.5.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image? 

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called `init` images. `Init` images are not currently supported. You can use an image URL as part of your prompt, but it is more of an "influence image" than a true init.

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What’s the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

Yes, the maximum image weight is 10000, but weights are relative to other weights in the prompt. Extreme weights will give diminishing returns. [A short guide on using image prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions)

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it — or -- ? Is it - or - -?

It is a double hyphen with no space (`--`) or an em-dash (`—`), followed by your parameter, with no space after the hyphens or emdash. For example: `--ar 16:9` and `—ar 16:9` are equally valid.

---

Q: What does :: do? What does double colons do? What does the + on the website do?

Double colons allow you to do multiple prompts (shown as a + on the website). You can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result.

More information here: [Advanced Text Weights](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual#advanced-text-weights).

Commas or other types of punctuation don’t usually have a noticeable effect on the final result. They’re mainly used to make the prompt more human-readable.

--- 

Q: Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image after I have generated different versions? Can I change the prompt after?

[Read more about Remix](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029507753389084692/1029507753389084692)

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts?

Here is a short guide on effective text prompts: [Tips on Text Prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/guide-to-prompting).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

No, the bot is not case-sensitive.

---

Q: How do you weigh text prompts?

You can suffix any part of the prompt with `::0.5` to give that part a weight of 0.5. If the weight is not specified, it defaults to 1;

Some examples: `/imagine hot dog::2 food::-1` - This sends a text prompt of `hot dog` with the weight 2 and `food` of weight -1.

`/imagine hot dog::0.5 animal::-0.25` - This sends `hot dog` of weight 0.5 and `animal` of negative 0.25.

`/imagine hot dog:: food::-1 animal::` - Sends `hot dog` of weight 1, `food` of weight -1 and `animal` of weight 1 (unspecified weights default to 1).

Watch out for prompts such as `/imagine hot dog animal::0.5`, as this will send the prompt of `hot dog animal` with weight 0.5, because of how it parses the text before the colons. The sum of weights also can not be lower than zero.

Check out this explanation for more info <#942231458918064148>: [Explainer](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148/960181257394868224).

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have. Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator.

[Read more about punctuation](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020733204283535401/1020733204283535401)


---

Q: This :: 2 that :: 3” or this : : that

Make sure that there is no space between colons and the weight. Your prompt should look like `phrase one::2 phrase two::1`

[Read more about weights](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020578042285920327/1020578042285920327)

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Anything over ~60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (Prompts must stay under 6000 characters.)

[Read more about prompt lengths](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1023119880976867368/1023119880976867368)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why teal and orange? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your stylization value might be too high. High stylization values will result in “pretty” but less nuanced results. Try lowering the stylization value in the `/settings` menu or by adding a stylize argument (ex. `--s 625`).

---

Q: What about “Unreal engine”? What about “Artstation”? What about “Octane render”?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

[Read about rendering words](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029786943141191700/1029786943141191700)

---

Q: What does quality do? How do you use  --q? How do you use --s? How do you use stylize? How do you use quality? What does stylize do? What is --s? What is --q?

*Quality*: Adjust the quality of your render by appending `--q` and the value of `.25`, `.5`, `1`, or `2`. Each level will adjust the GPU computation time and cost by the equivalent amount. Ex: `--q 2` The default is value is 1.

*Stylization* Adjust how closely the Bot follows your prompt by changing the stylization value. Append `--s` and a value between 0-1000. Lower values will follow your prompt closely. Higher values are more will have more variability. The default is value is 100.

# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? How do I DM myself the job results? How can I get an individual image without upscaling?

React to your image with the envelope emoji :envelope: and it will send it to you in DM.

%image=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167305579-1b2c461f-03d7-4aad-b14e-9ce0dd74fd9a.png

---

Q: Are the 4 initial images generated using the same seed?

In a way, yes. The seed is used to generate noise (think randomness) for all four images at once, so the noise is different for each image.

---

Q: How does --seed work? What does –seed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed?

*Seed* refers to the random noise added during the initialization of a generation. The same seed number can be used on different prompts using the `--seed` command. However, GPUs are non-deterministic, so images won't look exactly the same.

# -------------------- ------SHOW----- --------------------

Q: How to transfer an image to another channel? Can I move my image out of the newbies channel? Can I work with my old generations? My old generation is not responding to buttons? Can i upscale my old image from newbies channel? How to use /show?

You can use `/show` to transfer an image to another channel or your DMs. `/show` can also ‘revive’ a job that has stopped working. You will need the Job Id to use '/show'. Copy a job ID from the website by pressing the `copy job ID` button in the gallery under the menu.

Use `/show jobid` in any channel or your Direct Messages.
Example: `/show b052e414-a9f7-4f14-94fe-1a43e0aa656b`

# -------------------- ------VIDEO----- --------------------

Q: How do I get a video of my grid generating? Video? --video? Can I use –video on an upscale?

With **Version 3** and **Test/p** you can ask the AI to record the creation of the image you prompted. This __does not work with version 4__.

Add `--video` to the end of your prompt. Once the image has been rendered, react to it with the :envelope: emoji. Videos only work on the initial grid, not upscaled images.

[Read more about video](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1020703741432827934/1020703741432827934)

# -------------------- ------INFO------- --------------------



# -------------------- --DELETE X--------- --------------------

Q: How can I delete an image? How to delete images from my feed? How can I remove an image?

You can delete a generation by reacting to the post with the :x: emoji. Reacting with the :x: emoji also deletes the job from your gallery on the website.

If you cannot find your image on Discord, this same process will work with after recalling a job with the `/show` command.

Q: ExplainStop

Adding the `--stop` parameter will stop your generation at partway through. 


In this example: `/imagine prompt: a field of flowers --stop 50`
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in a softer less detailed image. 
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image. 

See [the documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#detail-modifiers), for more information.

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing.

Some words and phrases in prompts cause them to become ephemeral in Discord. This means only you can see those images, and they disappear from Discord when you restart or refresh. Ephemeral jobs can be identified by a “Only you can see this” note at the bottom of the completed image. Once these jobs have disappeared, you can recall them to Discord using the `/show` command.
