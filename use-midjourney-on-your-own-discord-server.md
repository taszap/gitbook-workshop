# Use Midjourney on your own Discord Server

**Currently the midjourney Bot can only be used in servers with less than 30,000 members.**

## Important Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no plan currently that allows users to share their subscription with others, even if they are on the same server.

To use the midjourney Bot in any server, users must have an active personal midjourney trial or subscription. Using the `/imagine` command for the first time will automatically begin a trial membership for new users.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Images generated with midjourney are always subject to the [content moderation policies](content-and-moderation-policy.md), even if they're generated on private servers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Images generated on private servers are still visible to other users on [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/all/). Users can prevent this by purchasing the [Private Visibility option](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/billing#private-visibility-option-+usd20-month) add-on.
{% endhint %}

## Use the midjourney Bot

Once the midjourney Bot has joined your server you can begin interacting with it using the `/imagine` command.

If this is your first time using midjourney, refer to othe [Quick Start Guide](./) for help making your first images.

## Restrict the Bot to Specific Channels

If you do not want the midjourney Bot to be usable in specific channels go to **Edit Channel**, select the **Permissions tab**, select **@everyone** under **Roles/Members** and **\_Uncheck\_ "Use Application Commands"**.

Users who try to use the midjourney Bot in a channel with these permissions disabled will not see the command
