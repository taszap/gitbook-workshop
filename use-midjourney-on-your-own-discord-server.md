# Use madjourney on your own Discord Server

**Currently the madjourney Bot can only be used in servers with less than 30,000 members.**

## Important Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no plan currently that allows users to share their subscription with others, even if they are on the same server.

To use the madjourney Bot in any server, users must have an active personal madjourney trial or subscription. Using the `/imagine` command for the first time will automatically begin a trial membership for new users.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Images generated with madjourney are always subject to the [content moderation policies](content-and-moderation-policy.md), even if they're generated on private servers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Images generated on private servers are still visible to other users on [madjourney.com](https://www.madjourney.com/app/feed/all/). Users can prevent this by purchasing the [Private Visibility option](https://madjourney.gitbook.io/docs/billing#private-visibility-option-+usd20-month) add-on.
{% endhint %}
